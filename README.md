# MiniWoB++ Second Project

In this GitHub repository, we created our second MiniWoB++ Reinforcement Learning Model in the environment: _click-button_. In this environment, our model will learn to click on the DOM element whose text matches the value of our `match` variable, which contains the text in quotation marks from our observation utterance, in less than 10 seconds.

The `utterance` is a string type variable that represents the task instruction string.
